# Hi there! Welcome to my First project..


## GIT links
https://codeanywhere.com/editor/#
I had to re-create the git a few times due to moving from cloud 9 and other things
the initial commits were made to https://github.com/ciaranq/MilestoneProject1-old
and https://github.com/ciaranq/project1-old. 
these contained some tests to get my project started, I will delete these.these
The git repo that contains the project is @

#### https://github.com/ciaranq/project1


## Development Environment
I started on cloud 9 but due to the change over to AWS educate I spent a lot of time recreating environments.
In addition the system would auto logout after 60 mins so it was really annoying.

I decided to find an alternative and looked at several IDE's for the mac.
I settled on codeanywhere.com (https://codeanywhere.com) as i was able to edit directly via ftp.
This allowed me to see my quickly project on a domain and made it easier to debug and find errors.

## Project Background


### Mockups by Hand
I started my project on paper and drafted a few ideas on paper. 
you can view them here, just select a file to have a look, 
I created a custom .htacees file to allow you see the file in the dir.you

### Favicon
I designed a favicon and this is referenced in my head.

### Wireframes in Adobe XD
Based on the feedback from the mentor I had to learn Adobe XD to do the wireframes.
the XD files are located @
https://ciaranquinlan.com/project1/design-documents/Adobe-xd/

It was a great idea to learn XD even if it took time from my project, 
it was very useful to design for mobile.

The jpgs of the design are here:
