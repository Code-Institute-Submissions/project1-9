# Hi there! Welcome to my First project..

## Project Background - South Kerry Greenway
I am planning to create a site for the upcoming South Kerry Greenway.
This initial site will have the outline structure that could be further developed into a more feature filled site.
This site shows the route and types services along the cycle route.

## Design
This explains the work I did before I started coding.

### Mockups by Hand
I started my project on paper and drafted a few ideas on paper. 
you can view them here, just select a file to have a look, 
I created a custom .htacees file to allow you see the file in the dir.you

### Color Scheme
Next thing was to decide on a color scheme, the color i wanted to use is located @
https://ciaranquinlan.com/project1/design-documents/Color/

### Favicon
I designed a favicon and this is referenced in my head.

### Wireframes in Adobe XD
Based on the feedback from the mentor I had to learn Adobe XD to do the wireframes.
the XD files are located @
https://ciaranquinlan.com/project1/design-documents/Adobe-xd/

It was a great idea to learn XD even if it took time from my project, 
it was very useful to design for mobile.
The jpgs of the design are here:

### Fonts and icons
The fonts I choose for the project are Limelight, Roboto and Montserrat.
They are recommended to be used together. see the references in the head.They
I found a lot of font awesome icons for my project. 
I had started to use glyphicons but I figured out that they are only bootstrap 3 
and using the messed up my bootstrap 4 code.

### Logo
I designed a logo using free tools, it looked terrible so i decided to just
use text at the moment. Here's my effort

##Planes
I used the methodology of the planes to flesh out what i was going to deliver.

### Strategy plane. - USER NEEDS/BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
- Business goals: build a portal for suppliers to market their greenway services.
- Monetise portal with a membership/subscriber/Traffic/advertising model 
- Initial idea: be first to market and buld a strong market leading SEO presence
- Why we want to build a product in the first place: first mover advantage
- What are we aiming to achieve and for whom?
1. get suppliers to signup for traffic
2. sell greenway badges and merchandise
3. one stop shop for route planning
- Culture of audience: Consumer site,  B2B backend, Multi-Lingual
- Who is the customer: what value do we add , what can the user expect
- importance/viability 
- look at other greenway sites, waterford, mayo, france etc


### Scope plane -FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION/CONTENT REQUIREMENTS
What features based on the strategy do we want to include in our design?
What's in the MVP?
- 2 suppliers for each category

- buy a badge to support greenway
- Basic PWA page

####Whats for later

### Structure plane. - INTERACTION DESIGN/INFORMATION DESIGN
How our information is structured and grouped
- how it's logically grouped - by activity, by region, by budget
- the features, 
- the elements, 
- the data, 
- the information.


### Skeleton plane. INTERFACE DESIGN/NAVIGATION DESIGN/INFORMATION DESIGN
navigation of the information
 - navigation: hierarchial or hub/spoke? 
 - Menus: Top nav bar
 - Social: social links
 - Beyond the structure, we have the skeleton.
- how the information should be implemented.
- How will the user navigate through the information and the features?
- How will the content relate to each other? 
- What relationships will the content have?
- What has priority? What has top priority? What has lower priority?
- here do we position the content?
- How do we navigate to those higher and lower priorities?


### Surface plane. VISUAL DESIGN
What will the product actually look like?
- colors : Green, Gold? Kerry colors, Green for Greenway - emerald
- typography : Celtic scripts?  ie Celtics Modern google font
- images : avtivity, vibrant, healthy, 
- design elements: Colllaspe/expanding sections?
- animations : bike travelling? 
- transitions
- other effects 


# UX
Our UX must be useful, useable and valuable.

- Useful to the user - gives good info 
- Useable - can be used on the go and they can return again to get more 
- Valuable - they cannot get this info elsewhere as easy.


### Mobile First

## Deployment

### Development Environment
I started on cloud 9 but due to the change over to AWS educate I spent a lot of time recreating environments.
In addition the system would auto logout after 60 mins so it was really annoying.

I decided to find an alternative and looked at several IDE's for the mac.
I settled on codeanywhere.com (https://codeanywhere.com) as i was able to edit directly via ftp.
This allowed me to see my quickly project on a domain and made it easier to debug and find errors.
visit this link for the project
https://ciaranquinlan.com/project1

I also connected my mac by ftp to the domain so i had a local copy of my file, this facilitated offline editing
where i use the brackets editor.

Connecting  to git was a bit long winded as i have not yet connected the codeanywhere ftp instance to git.
The two options i were using were
1. Ftp down the site to my local pc & use git in my terminal to update the repo
2. Use a ssh program to log into my domain and connect my domain to git and update this way.

### Deployment
I am editing directly on a domain using an online IDE.
Everything is located on https://ciaranquinlan.com/project1

I can fpt down the files and edit locally.

I plan to use Visual Studio in the future but Im very happy with this setup as it allows me to
use a pc or a mac to edit and run the project.


## GIT links
https://codeanywhere.com/editor/#
I had to re-create the git a few times due to moving from cloud 9 and other things
the initial commits were made to https://github.com/ciaranq/MilestoneProject1-old
and https://github.com/ciaranq/project1-old. 
these contained some tests to get my project started, I will delete these sometime after submission
The git repo that contains the project is @
