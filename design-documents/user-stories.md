# UX
Our UX must be useful, useable and valuable.

- Useful to the user - gives good info 
- Useable - can be used on the go and they can return again to get more 
- Valuable - they cannot get this info elsewhere as easy.


## Strategy plane. - USER NEEDS/BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

- Business goals: build a portal for suppliers to market their greenway services.
- Monetise portal with a membership/subscriber/Traffic/advertising model

- Why we want to build a product in the first place: first mover advantage
- What are we aiming to achieve and for whom?
1. get suppliers to signup for traffic
2. sell greenway badges and merchandise
3. one stop shop for route planning
- Culture of audience: Consumer site,  B2B backend, Multi-Lingual
- Who is the customer: what value do we add , what can the user expect
- importance/viability 

- look at other greenway sites, waterford, mayo, france etc

What features based on the strategy do we want to include in our design?
What's in the MVP?
- 2 suppliers for each category

# South Kerry Greenway
I am planning to create a site for the new upcoming South Kerry Greenway.
This initial site will have the outline structure that could be further developed into a more feature filled site.
This site shows the route and types services along the route.


# UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, 
focusing on who this website is for, 
what it is that they want to achieve and how your project 
is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend 
that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, 
I want to perform an action, 
so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where 
you would share links to any wireframes, 
mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part 
of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included 
in the project itself (in an separate directory), 
or just hosted elsewhere online and can be 
in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

# Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific 
project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for 
additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, 
frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to 
construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its 
official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have 
conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories 
from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project 
providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, 
provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually 
and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing 
your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on 
different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you 
discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate 
file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project 
to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the 
deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
